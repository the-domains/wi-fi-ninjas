It has been a fantastic start to 2016 for the Wi-Fi industry. The Wi-Fi
Alliance is racing ahead with the new HaLow (802.11ah) standard for IoT and new
blazingly fast 'WiGig' (802.11ad) routers are hitting the markets. But here's
what I think is going to be the Wi-Fi success story of 2016: City Wi-Fi,
LinkNYC-style. 

The prospect of City Wi-Fi networks everywhere got a huge boost with the
announcement that -- finally -- the long-awaited LinkNYC project is underway in
the Big Apple. Thousands of Wi-Fi enabled high-tech 'kiosks' are replacing old
payphones across NYC boroughs serving up free Wi-Fi, charging stations for your
phone, big-screen ads, and free phone calls. 

LinkNYC is a big deal for City Wi-Fi everywhere because the project is a
lot more than just dishing out free Wi-Fi to anyone who wants it. To my
knowledge this the first attempt in bringing together free Wi-Fi with
big-screen advertising & data analytics at street level in a major city.
Add to this political support by the City and backing by -- among others -
Google, we could have the first landslide city Wi-Fi success in NYC. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a53bf3c-3237-4038-9786-39dd4309e977.jpg)

The LinkNYC consortium has re-imagined street furniture design out from
the bottom up. The driver for the whole thing is ads: The company expects to
cash in a whopping 500 million dollars on ad revenues in 12 years or so.
Instead of pushing ads to your device (LinkNYC doesn't do this), they've gone
for tried-and-true big screen ads. Blazing 55-inch screens on every street
corner of NYC may be just the eyeball draw that advertisers are looking for. Not
every city will want something like this, but many just might. 

A big part of the value that LinkNYC is pitching to advertisers is Wi-Fi
based data analytics. Now we don't exactly know what kind of data LinkNYC will
be harvesting. At the very least they will be counting footfall and (we're
fairly sure) anonymising the data to avoid privacy concerns. Data like that
will go a long way towards 'counting eyeballs', and advertisers will like that.

By going with big screens instead of pushing ads to your device, LinkNYC
also gets around what a lot of people frankly despise: Being marketed something
that they don't want. Earlier in 2015, AT&T Wi-Fi had to decommission their
ad-injection approach to Wi-Fi advertising aftera slew of bad press.  In contrast, it's not likely that New Yorkers
will complain about a few more digital billboards. 

The other important part of the story is _how_

LinkNYC is serving up the free Wi-Fi: LinkNYC will be one of
just small handful of Passpoint-enabled City Wi-Fi networks and -- by the time
it's all rolled out -- by far the largest. Once you've singed up for this, you
will not only have your device connect by itself as soon as it is in range. The
service is also as secure as it gets in the Wi-Fi world.

The next step is to get Passpoint-enabled
City Wi-Fi services to roaming with each other, which is precisely what
Passpoint was designed for in the first place. 

LinkNYC may be the biggest and most ambitious ad-based & analytics
Wi-Fi project around, but the idea is not lost on retailers. In September of
2015 

_Samsung _and Finland-based _Walkbase _kicked of a similar concept: Harvesting Wi-Fi analytics for enhancing the
retail consumer experience and presenting (we hope!) useful information on
in-store digital signage. 

We still need
a couple of big-name retailers to get seriously engaged in this. But I'm
betting that this will also happen in 2016\. 

In truth, it's still early days for making money on Wi-Fi with ads and
analytics. But the Wi-Fi industry has taken the first big leap projects like
these. 

In the end, big screens -
preferably with useful and personalized information - may turn out to be a
catalyst for new Wi-Fi business models. And they will avoid altogether the
'creepiness' and annoyance of ads invading the personal space on your
smartphone.

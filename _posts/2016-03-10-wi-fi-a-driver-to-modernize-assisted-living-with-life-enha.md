Digital signage,
location-based services, big data analytics, VoWi-Fi, Internet of Things,
Machine-to-Machine, and heterogeneous cellular networks with Carrier Wi-Fi are
some of the most interesting trends in the enterprise segment.

Today enterprises are embracing a
mobile-first strategy to improve productivity of their own business, better
engage with their customers, and provide them a high quality experience. While
sectors such as hospitality, retail and education are early adopters, niche
segments such as assisted living are now gradually catching up.

According to Immersion
Active, nearly 77% of those aged 50-60 years are online, while of those aged 65
years or more, nearly 54% are online. These next generation residents,
comprising Baby Boomers, are more tech-savvy and expect to use their mobile
devices and applications for staying connected and maintaining control of their
lives. The decision to select an assisted living facility is therefore
influenced by availability of an undisrupted and ubiquitous Wi-Fi connectivity
that enables residents to easily connect whenever and wherever they want,
without always having to rely on wired solution.

As Wi-Fi increasingly
drives modernization of senior care, CIOs of assisted living facilities
continue to face the following challenges:

1\.  Wi-Fi is not simple
enough to be managed by existing in-house IT team 

2\.  Wi-Fi lacks security
to assure private resident experience & BYOD

3\.  Wi-Fi is not designed
with mobility and IoT in mind 

4\.  Wi-Fi is not optimized
for real time engagement

5\.  Wi-Fi is not architected
to be scalable and ubiquitous

Simple, secure
and scalable Wi-Fi infrastructure is therefore critical for assisted living
providers to enable delivery of high quality and life enriching experience to senior
residents. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c108c3c0-1486-421b-8115-e739561e0ad3.jpg)

While there
are many capabilities that are important in the evaluation of a WLAN solution,
a few that are critical to assisted living facilities are:

**__**

**_High Performance_**

One of the
challenges most facilities face in deploying modern care solutions is assuring
Wi-Fi coverage in traditional buildings. The type of building construction and
material used has a big impact on designing and implementing a Wi-Fi solution.
Each use case, whether it is video chatting with grand kids, creating Wi-Fi
personal emergency response system, wander management system, or it is
implementing a resident safety system, has its own challenges. Dropped calls,
weak signals, dead zones are some of the most common pain points experienced by
residents and staff at assisted living facilities. A high performing wireless
infrastructure that provides high speed connectivity anywhere in residents'
homes, common areas, and throughout the campus is essential to assure best care
and keep senior residents happy. 

Samsung
brings with it years of experience in identifying and troubleshooting any form
of potential interference, as well as gauging use case specific requirements
early in the process. Samsung's WLAN solution leverages several unique
technologies such as self-optimizing network, smart antenna solution, and air time
fairness to assure uninterrupted Wi-Fi connectivity under any circumstances.

**_Strong Security _**

Assisted
living facilities are highly regulated and require compliance with HIPAA
requirements to ensure all sensitive health information is securely transmitted
over wireless network. 

With wide
adoption of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies and the Internet of Things
revolution, legacy security measures are not enough to secure WLAN solutions. In-built
security options ensure that end-user devices properly authenticate and access
networked resources, significantly reducing chances of data breaches. Assisted
living facilities should be prepared to answer questions on advanced security
capabilities such as accurate identification of users/ devices, automated
onboarding/ off-boarding capabilities, device and operating system posture
assessment/ remediation, and context-aware policy enforcement. 

Samsung's
wireless solution is therefore implemented keeping in mind various compliance
requirements for a more secure health environment.

Samsung offers centralized Access Point management and policy
control with built in intrusion detection, alerts, and prevention, assuring IT
managers have granular controls to provide secure yet simple Wi-Fi access to
both residents and their guests.

**_Ease of Management_**

While Wi-Fi
solution is becoming imperative for the success of assisted living providers,
operators struggle with limited budget and lack of skilled and dedicated IT
staff.

Designing, configuring,
and managing WLAN solution can become complex. IT teams therefore need to be
trained so they are able to easily use the WLAN controller's management
interface and troubleshoot minor problems. Though some remote support from system
integrators is essential, IT teams consider ease of management as an essential
criterion while evaluating WLAN solutions.
